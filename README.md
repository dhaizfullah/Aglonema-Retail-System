# Information System Analysis: Aglonema Parung Digital Transformation

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the strategic digital transformation of **Aglonema Parung**, a retail business established in 2019. The goal was to conduct a comprehensive system analysis to transition their manual, fragmented operations (Instagram, WhatsApp, and E-commerce) into an integrated web-based information system.

## My Role: System Analyst
As the lead System Analyst, I acted as the bridge between client business needs and technical requirements. My work centered on gathering field data and translating it into a formal **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**.

### Key Responsibilities:
* **Client Needs Analysis & Observation:** Conducted in-depth interviews and observations to map the client's current business processes and identify operational bottlenecks, such as manual stock management and fragmented promotion.
* **Requirements Gathering:** Translated client pain points into a structured set of functional requirements, including automated stock management and integrated product catalogs.
* **Gap Analysis:** Evaluated the "as-is" manual state versus the "to-be" digital state to ensure the proposed system provides a modern and efficient shopping experience.
* **Strategic Project Scheduling:** Developed a comprehensive project timeline using **Gantt Charts**, covering stages from initial data collection to final system validation.
* **Data Architecture Mapping:** Identified and structured core data entities (Products, Categories, Reviews, and Care Guides) required to support integrated digital operations.

## Proposed System Features (Based on Analysis)
Based on my analysis, the system was designed to fulfill the following client needs:
* **Integrated Product Management:** Centralized control for adding, editing, and deleting inventory.
* **Automated Stock Tracking:** Real-time visibility into product availability.
* **Educational Care Guides:** A value-added feature to provide plant care instructions for customers.
* **Social Proof Integration:** A verified review system to build digital credibility.

## Deliverables
* **Software Requirements Specification (SRS) v1.0:** A formal document detailing all system perspectives, functional requirements, and data needs.
* **Strategic Development Roadmap:** A time-bound execution plan from 2025 to 2026.
